- Given the following number: 10010011. How do you change the second bit to 1 and the last bit to 0 with bitwise operators without changing the other bits? 

    #include <stdint.h>

    uint8_t byte = 0b10010011;
    byte |= 1 << 6;
    byte &= 0b11111110;

- What's the difference between pseudo random number generation and true random number generation?

True random number generation uses some non-reproducible physical phenomena to generate its output, like real time analysis of a video of several lava-lamps. 
Pseudo random number generation relies on reproducible mathematical formulas and algorithms, which mimick randomness. Most of the time this is good enough, 
and it is even more reliable and cost effective in most cases.
