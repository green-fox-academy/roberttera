/*
Create a so called circular buffer library.
The circular buffer can be implemented with an array and some logic.
For detailed descroption please visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer
For the implementation create a structure, which represents the circular buffer and
holds its necessary variables. The structure shuold be designd in a way to allow
multiple circular buffer definitions.

The circular buffer librarby should be implemented in separete .c/.h files.
